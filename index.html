        <h2>Why would I need it?</h2>
        <p>
          In certain video games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, the 'Photo Mode' feature stores its captured images in a
          distinct directory, resulting in Steam failing to recognize them as conventional screenshots. If you, like me,
          find the desire to share these images as regular screenshots rather than classifying them as artworks or the
          like, then this tool is designed to streamline this process for you, providing a more convenient solution.
