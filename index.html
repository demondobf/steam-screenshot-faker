        <h2>Why would I need it?</h2>
        <p>
          In certain video games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, the 'Photo Mode' feature stores its captured images in a
          distinct directory, resulting in Steam failing to recognize them as conventional screenshots. If you, like me,
          find the desire to share these images as regular screenshots rather than classifying them as artworks or the
          like, then this tool is designed to streamline this process for you, providing a more convenient solution.
        </p>

        <h2>How to use it?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Uploading Your Photo:</b> Begin by uploading your chosen photo. Take a moment to review it and ensure
            everything is to your satisfaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Download Full-Size and Thumbnail Images:</b> Once you're content with your photo, proceed to download
            both the full-size and thumbnail versions of the image. Please note that the generated filenames may
            occasionally be inaccurate, so it's advisable to verify them before proceeding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Saving Your Files:</b> Save these downloaded image files in the same location where Steam typically
            stores its screenshots.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Restarting Steam:</b> Application won't see new photos (I think it's related to permission issues), Steam
            will automatically crawl through the directory and set the permissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Troubleshooting:</b> In the event that something doesn't go as planned, I recommend creating a dummy
            screenshot, such as one taken in a menu within the game, and then simply overwrite the existing file with
            the freshly downloaded images. This method can serve as a useful workaround to rectify any issues that may
            arise.
